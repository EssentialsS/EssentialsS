# Essentials-s

Essentials-S is yet another Essentials plugin, only this time it is for the Sponge platform.

The Essentials-S plugin is designed to give your server all essential commands and actions you expect from a server as well as some you don't normally expect.

Features like

- Chat management
- World management
- Teleport Requests
- So much more

can all be found in Essentials-S.

## Why Essentials S?

Essentials-S was built from the ground up with Sponge API 8 in mind and designed to work on multiple Sponge API versions. Essentials-S was created due to the
passing of ``Nucleus``.

## Where can I download?

## How do I use XY or Z?

## Do you support API 9 and onwards

Currently, the focus is on API 8, however API 9 and 10 should work now and will get offical support when ready
